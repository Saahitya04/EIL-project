Hey Peeps !
I've completed and pushed the backend and database setup to the repository. Here's a summary of what has been done:

🚀   Backend Setup Done :
✔ Spring Boot project with all necessary packages and controllers
✔ PostgreSQL integrated and configured
✔ All required entities, repositories, services, and controllers are implemented:
      :Employee, Department, Leave, Salary, Attendance, User, WorkAssignment and related controllers/services


🔐   JWT Security Setup :
✔JWT-based authentication is implemented and working.
✔We updated the JWT secret to meet HMAC-SHA256 security requirements:
   :Used a secure 256-bit key in application.properties under jwt.secret
   :This prevents the WeakKeyException error from occurring during token generation.
✔Authentication endpoints (/api/auth/register and /api/auth/login) were tested successfully via Postman.
✔Verified token generation and access to protected routes using Authorization headers.


🛠  Other Configuration :
✔application.properties includes
    : DB config for PostgreSQL (jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/eilproject)
    : JWT secret securely set
    : Hibernate dialect and SQL formatting enabled
✔Logging level for Spring Security is set to DEBUG for easier debugging during development.


✅ Status
✔Backend development 
✔API endpoints tested 
✔Connected to PostgreSQL 
✔Project pushed to GitHub
